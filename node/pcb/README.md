# Note

The `teamagotchi.zip` contains the pcb design. It was zipped because the containing files can not be handled by Windows as some contain a ":" in the filename.
This could be fixed if Windows all users would set `git config core.protectNTFS false`
(see [StackOverflow: github/git Checkout Returns 'error: invalid path' on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63727594/github-git-checkout-returns-error-invalid-path-on-windows)
but this ain't gonna happen.
